# CarPrice_Prediction-Linear-Regression
A machine learning illustration with the ability to predict the car price with the accuracy of 72%. I have employed the various techniques of exploratory data analysis with the data visualisation libraries matplotlib and seaborn. This project has a complete workflow in the following sequence:
        1. Problem Statement
        2. Dataset Selection
        3. Reading and Understanding the Dataset
        4. Data Cleaning and Preparation
        5. Visualizing the data
        6. Encoding the Categorical data
        7. Train - Test Split and Feature Scaling
        8. Model Building
        9. Prediction and Evaluation of model
        10. Insights
